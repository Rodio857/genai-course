As we did last year, we want to share some product usage patterns thatshowcase how the AI ecosystem and practice of building LLM apps are evolving.As folks have traced, evaluated, and iterated their way around LangSmith,we’ve seen a few notable changes. These include the dramatic rise of open-source model adoption and a shift from predominantly retrieval workflows to AIagent applications with multi-step, agentic workflows. Dive into the stats below to learn exactly what developers are building, testing,and prioritizing.Infrastructure usageWith Large Language Models (LLMs) eating the world, everyone’s asking themirror-mirror-on-the-wall question: “Which model is the most utilized of themall?” Let’s unpack what we’ve seen.Top LLM providersLike last year’s results, OpenAI reigns as the most used LLM provider amongLangSmith users — used more than 6x as much as Ollama, the next-mostpopular provider (counted by LangSmith organization usage).\n",

      "Interestingly, Ollama and Groq (which both allow users to run open sourcemodels, with the former focusing on local execution and the latter on clouddeployment) have accelerated in momentum this year, breaking into the top 5.This shows a growing interest in more flexible deployment options andcustomizable AI infrastructure.\n",

      "When it comes to providers that offer open-source models, the top providershave stayed relatively consistent compared to last year - Ollama, Mistral, andHugging Face have made it easy for developers to run open source models ontheir platforms. These OSS providers’ collective usage represents 20% of thetop 20 LLM providers (by the number of organizations using them). Top Retrievers / Vector StoresPerforming retrieval is still critical for many GenAI workflows. The top 3 vectorstores have remained the same as last year, with Chroma and FAISS as the mostpopular choices. This year, Milvus, MongoDB, and Elastic’s vector databaseshave also entered the top 10. \n",

      "While langchain (our open source framework) is central to many folks’ LLMapp development journeys, 15.7% of LangSmith traces this year come fromnon-langchainframeworks. This reflects a broader trend where observabilityis needed regardless of what framework you’re using to build the LLM app —and that interoperability is supported by LangSmith.Python remains dominant, while JavaScript usagegrowsDebugging, testing, and monitoring certainly has a special place in our Pythondevelopers’ hearts, with 84.7% usage coming from the Python SDK. But there isa notable and growing interest in JavaScript as developers pursue web-firstapplications — the JavaScript SDK accounts for 15.3% of LangSmith usage thisyear, increasing 3x compared to the previous year. AI agents are gaining tractionAs companies are getting more serious about incorporating AI agents acrossvarious industries, adoption of our controllable agent framework, LangGraph,is also on the rise. Since its release in March 2024, LangGraph has steadilygained traction — with 43% of LangSmith organizations are now sendingLangGraph traces. These traces represent complex, orchestrated tasks that gobeyond basic LLM interactions.\n",

      "6 of 1230/01/25, 11:58 AM\n",
      "This growth aligns with the rise in agentic behavior: we see that on average21.9% of traces now involve tool calls, up from an average of 0.5% in 2023.Tool calling allows a model to autonomously invoke functions or externalresources, signaling more agentic behavior where the model decides when totake action. Increased use of tool calling can enhance an agent’s ability tointeract with external systems and perform tasks like writing to databases. \n",

Below, we explorehow organizations are interacting with their applications to align thecomplexity of their needs with efficient performance.Complexity is growing, but tasks are being handledefficiently  The average number of steps per trace has more than doubled over the pastyear, rising from onaverage 2.8 steps (2023) to 7.7 steps (2024). We define astep as a distinct operation within a trace, such as a call to an LLM, retriever, ortool. This growth in steps signals that organizations are leveraging morecomplex and multi-faceted workflows. Rather than a simple question-answerinteraction, users are building systems that chain together multiple tasks, suchas retrieving information, processing it, and generating actionable results.\n",

While it’s no easy feat tokeep the quality of your LLM app high, we see organizations usingLangSmith’s evaluation capabilities to automate testing and generate userfeedback loops to create more robust, reliable applications.LLM-as-Judge: Evaluating what mattersLLM-as-Judge evaluators capture grading rules into an LLM prompt and use theLLM to score whether the output adheres to specific criteria.

      "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PEDRO PASCAL! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE. THANK YOU. I SPENT THE LAST YEAR SHOOTING A SHOW CALLED \"THE LAST OF US\" ON HBO. FOR SOME HBO SHOES, YOU GET TO SHOOT IN A FIVE STAR ITALIAN RESORT SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, BUT I SAID, NO, THAT'S TOO EASY. I WANT TO SHOOT IN A FREEZING CANADIAN FOREST WHILE BEING CHASED AROUND BY A GUY WHOSE HEAD LOOKS LIKE A GENITAL WART. IT IS AN HONOR BEING A PART OF THESE HUGE FRANCHISEs LIKE \"GAME OF THRONES\" AND \"STAR WARS,\" BUT I'M STILL GETTING USED TO PEOPLE RECOGNIZING ME. THE OTHER DAY, A GUY STOPPED ME ON THE STREET AND SAYS, MY SON LOVES \"THE MANDALORIAN\" AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I'M FACE TIMING WITH A 6-YEAR-OLD WHO HAS NO IDEA WHO I AM BECAUSE MY CHARACTER WEARS A MASK THE ENTIRE SHOW. THE GUY IS LIKE, DO THE MANDO VOICE, BUT IT'S LIKE A BEDROOM VOICE. WITHOUT THE MASK, IT JUST SOUNDS PORNY. PEOPLE WALKING BY ON THE STREET SEE ME WHISPERING TO A 6-YEAR-OLD KID. I CAN BRING YOU IN WARM, OR I CAN BRING YOU IN COLD. EVEN THOUGH I CAME TO THE U.S. WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND I HAVE 34 FIRST COUSINS WHO ARE STILL THERE. THEY'RE VERY PROUD OF ME. I KNOW THEY'RE PROUD BECAUSE THEY GIVE MY PHONE NUMBER TO EVERY PERSON THEY MEET, WHICH MEANS EVERY DAY, SOMEONE IN SANTIAGO WILL TEXT ME STUFF LIKE, CAN YOU COME TO MY WEDDING, OR CAN YOU SING MY PRIEST HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OR IS BABY YODA MEAN IN REAL LIFE. SO I HAVE TO BE LIKE NO, NO, AND HIS NAME IS GROGU. BUT MY COUSINS WEREN'T ALWAYS SO PROUD. EARLY IN MY CAREER, I PLAYED SMALL PARTS IN EVERY CRIME SHOW. I EVEN PLAYED TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS ON \"LAW AND ORDER.\" TITO CABASSA WHO LOOKED LIKE THIS. AND ONE YEAR LATER, I PLAYED REGGIE LUCKMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THIS. AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS CALLED RANGE. BUT IT IS AMAZING TO BE HERE, LIKE I SAID. I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND NINE MONTHS LATER, MY PARENTS FLED AND BROUGHT ME AND MY SISTER TO THE U.S. THEY WERE SO BRAVE, AND WITHOUT THEM, I WOULDN'T BE HERE IN THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY, AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE WITH YOU ALL TONIGHT. SO TO ALL MY FAMILY WATCHING IN CHILE, I WANT TO SAY [ SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH ] WHICH MEANS, I LOVE YOU, I MISS YOU, AND STOP GIVING OUT MY PHONE NUMBER. WE'VE GOT AN AMAZING SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. COLDPLAY IS HERE, SO STICK\n"
